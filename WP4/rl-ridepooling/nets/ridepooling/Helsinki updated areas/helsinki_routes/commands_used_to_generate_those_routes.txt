The command to run cutRoutes is `python $SUMO_HOME/tools/route/cutRoutes.py`

The config files contain configurations that were used for cutting routes.
The exact commands to run these config files are provided below

Before running cutRoutes, you need to have the sim_routes.rou.xml file that contains the exit times
Note that when getting those routes it's important to run the simulation not for 1 hour, 
but until all the vehicles reach the destination. 
This way, the exit times will be compluted for every route, 
not only for those that made it in time.
You should also set the 'departLane="free"' and 'departSpeed="max"' attributes for each route in sim_routes.rou.xml
In the config files, the processed sim_routes.rou.xml file is referred to as sim_routes_depart_attrs_set.rou.xml
